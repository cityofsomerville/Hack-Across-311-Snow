102638,Saugus,Pothole,Archived,"Hello, I live at the end of Dewey Street and wanted to seek help with the end of the street. The rain water runs down the street and has washed out the end of my driveway quite severely, and has created a large ditch at the end of the street, near the conservation land.  The snow plows get stuck in this every year, and it is becoming quite large and deep.  I'd like to fix my driveway and put a ""lip"" at the end to keep the water running smoothly down the street, but was advised to let the town know of the problem that the water is causing and see if it can be fixed.  I also don't want to fix the driveway, and then have it torn up with any roadwork that may be done.  I'd be glad to walk through the problem with anyone.  Please let us know asap if there is any plan to repair the road, as either way, I do need to fix my driveway, as the water runs into the driveway, washing out the end and ultimately under my front porch, which I fear will be washed out, since it gets all of the water from the street.  There is currently a lip in place, which basically just stops.  If this were to be extended, the entire problem would seem to be solved.  If there is a plan to repair this problem, I'll wait on fixing the driveway, otherwise I'll get to work right away, but need to make a decision soon.  I can be reached at 781-233-9175 or 781-520-9360.

1008762,Town of Easton,Other,Archived,"The surface of the cul-de-sac slants towards the 18 Thoreau Drive driveway. This causes the collection of water from rain or melted snow. The water collects in front of the driveway. To remedy the issue, about 2 years ago the Department of Public Works place a patch there . This only made it worse because the patch elevates the surface adjacent to the sewer and prevents the water going to the sewer. When the snow melts or when it rains, the pool of water becomes quite deep and there is no escape route for it. Please apply a permanent solution.

Since there is no curb along this section near Maryl Dr., the dirt and soil that lies along the edge of the pavement is regularly washed away and spread down the hill.  It's beginning to become a mess for us and our neighbors, especially after the snow melt these past couple months.  I've personally tried lining cobblestones along the side of the road, in attempt to create a curb-like structure to prevent the erosion, with no luck at all.The granite curb comes to an end just before this erosion.

1413194,Nantucket,Streets/Roads,Acknowledged,"South Cambridge St.  Followup and summary of an ongoing issue. I would like to thank the DPW Administration for acknowledging this issue, as well as our concerns and frustrations. In a recent post a comment was made that in the past S. Cambridge was only graded twice a year and is now graded monthly. Unfortunately times have changed and the bandaid repairs of the past are no longer sufficient for a multitude of reasons given the changes in population and road usage.1. There is no gravel or hardener on this road. Years of repeated blade grading have reduced this road to soft sand which ruts and forms pot holes immediately after grading because of traffic and weather conditions. Furthermore there has never been any crowning of So. Cambridge St. to control runoff during heavy rains and avoid the gullies that form.2. There is a lot of major construction in the surrounding area and very large construction vehicles accelerate the damage. 3. Overall there are more people living in the surrounding area.     a. There are more year round residents.     b. There are more people using their properties in the shoulder season.      c. We are also concerned that emergency vehicle response time is hampered by these nearly impassable roads.4. Some of us have incurred significant damage to our cars. The front end of my car was totaled last winter and was beyond repair. Last year we were told that once the ground freezes that routine maintenance cannot be performed. With partially frozen water in large potholes and a light covering of snow the pot hole become invisible and a menace to car suspensions.It is time for the Town to develop a long term solution.  Repeated band-aids are so temporary that they are useless and not cost effective.  We would like to establish a dialogue between the neighborhood and the DPW, so we can work together to make a long term fix a Town priority.  Who shall we contact to start this process?",,,,12/22/2014 06:27:54 PM,12/23/2014 01:31:19 PM,,,,"(41.274631, -70.185932)",

Just wondering if anyone knew when a plow might be on our street (Hazard St. between County and Summer).  Don't know why they didn't continue across County when they plowed the bottom of Hazard.

1477097,Woburn,Street Maintenance,Closed,"This is our fourth complaint with this issue. Conn Street is not wide enough for two-way traffic and parked vehicles. It has become a dangerous situation with the constant trucks, other vehicles, and pedestrians that travel down this road. The snow is at LEAST three feet into the road from the curb in some areas, especially at the entryway of parking lots and driveways, where plows seem to push the snow into mounds that make the situation worse. The mounds are also huge at the intersection at Conn and Fowle Streets, making it difficult for cars who are turning onto either street, because they cannot see oncoming traffic. Sidewalks are not shoveled, either, in many parts, so pedestrians are walking on the extremely narrow roadway. In the small parts where sidewalks are cleared a tiny bit, vehicles are parking their cars on them because there is no room on the street! Currently, the street is at least half covered with slush and ice, because it seems the road is rarely even salted, as well. We understand there has been an overwhelming amount of snow these past few weeks, but it has been almost two weeks since the biggest storm and now we are expecting even more. When we were hit with a big storm two years ago, bobcats and snow removal trucks came to Conn Street almost immediately following. This past month has been far worse and residents in the area have received little to no help from the city. Are we waiting for a pedestrian to get hit and killed, or for a car collision, before we fix this issue?

In this one block radius, there are very large piles of snow that need to be removed on the parking side of the street. We have all tried to shovel them down but have know-where to put the snow and it is all turning to ice now. Only one car can fit down this main road and large trucks are getting stuck while turning onto the block on a daily basis. Nobody can shovel out a spot to park because the piles will melt a little bit then the section turns into a sheet of ice. The piles also cause the sidewalks to becomes sheets of ice.I've noticed Front End Loaders all over the city removing piles of snow and was wondering if that can be done on our block too? Seeing as it is more of a main road and it is used by Middle School and High School traffic all week, I am hoping this will be a priority. I've been watching kids struggle to stay on the sidewalk due to the piles of snow and a lot of them end up having to walk in the road. I pray that they don't get hit by a car! I've seen comments from the DPI stating that cleaning up the school areas are the first priority. If that is true then our area should be on that list of priorities since it is one of the busiest main roads to both the middle and high school.

I called the fire department (non-emergency line) several days ago and was told ""We'll add it to the list."" What can I do to have this taken seriously? It seems hypocritical to beg residents to dig out hydrants and to make them aware of the dangers of inaccessible hydrants but then completely ignore broken and inaccessible hydrants when they are reported. This is a serious safety issue for anyone in this area. Right now we are just hoping nothing catches fire in any of the five units in our building or in any of the homes and condo buildings surrounding us.",,02/11/2015 11:05:44 AM,,02/08/2015 01:50:38 PM,02/16/2015 03:19:24 PM,,,,"(42.5230934456, -70.8827429804)",https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0028/6521/IMG_6660.JPG

1480787,Chelmsford,Snow Plowing/Removal,Acknowledged,"First, I wan to commend the person who plows Kensington Drive.  He has done an excellent job this season, keeping the roads as clean and wide as possible.  He knows how to plow from the middle of the street out to keep the road passable at all times.  The same cannot be said of the truck (has 'Russell' printed on side of truck) that plows Ansie Road.At approximately 2 pm on 2/9 I saw him dump the end of street snow on his blade in front of the fire hydrant at the intersection of Ansie and Kensington. He saw an open area (because I had just cleaned in front of the hydrant) and dumped his snow there, making no effort to keep the hydrant area somewhat clear.  I know the plow drivers can't keep the hydrants clear, and I don't mind doing it, but when a plow places snow in front of it, that is objectionable.  I am 67 years old with a small 2 stage blower.  I expect to see Russell plowing come and clear up their mess even if the have to use a teaspoon to do it!

1481422,Holyoke,Streets and Sidewalks,Open,"1 The street has not been adequately plowed before  parking reversals. This has occurred repeatedly this winter. + 2 Timing parking changes for 7-8 am puts drivers on both sides just as school buses are trying to get through. = 3 The last major storm led to school bus delays as some people were late moving their cars & unresponsive at their doors, so people who had complied with the reversal then had to move back to the original side in order for buses to pass and then move them back again after. Today, the school buses simply backed out because they could not pass, and pick-up trucks, SUV's and vans are having a very hard time getting through.Solutions, please: 1) Plow thoroughly BEFORE the reversal happens, even if that means making an additional pass in the morning after DPW comes on duty but before the parking change. 2) Schedule parking changes for later in the morning so that a) fewer cars are in residential areas at that time, and b) school buses have already passed. If either of these steps require changes to DPW staff schedules, then please make that happen -- contracts & schedules should meet Holyoke's residents' needs rather than having 40,000 people trying to meet DPW's needs.I appreciate the hard work of many civil servants, and I understand this has been a particularly bad winter, but the plowing situation (not the snow situation per se) is the worst I've seen in 19 years here, and my neighbors who've been on this block since the 1960's say it's also the worst street clearing they've ever seen here.

1481269,Woburn,Other,Closed,I live on a street plowed by the Woburn Housing Authority.

This evening I saw the housing authority plow truck actually pushing snow into my driveway.  This is frustrating and unnecessary.

1490254,Stoneham,Other,Closed,STEEP HILLSJust wondering if the town prioritizes the sanding and salting of steep hills in town when it comes to snow storms and afterwards. I live on Glen Road and the hill is quite steep. If it is not aggressively plowed and heavily sanded and salted it becomes impossible to get home. If you try to get home you risk getting stuck in the snowbank requiring a tow truck to free you. That's a $90 fee.Via this report I am asking that the DPW address this concern. Perhaps speaking to the plow driver or contractor assigned to the route that includes Glen Road would help alleviate this problem.It's a real concern when you can't get home or risk damage to your vehicle if you do.The hill needs HEAVY SAND & SALT. Please help those of us who live on the hill. It just requires some extra attention due to the steep grade. Thank you all so much!!!,,02/19/2015 02:50:54 PM,,02/16/2015 04:50:40 PM,02/19/2015 02:50:54 PM,,,,"(42.4785278928, -71.1086035847)",

We were wondering if there's any way that the entrance to Charles Street to/from Main St. could be widened and the street treated more for ice. It's been very difficult coming and going to/from Charles St. and Main Street since the road has become very much 1 lane. We also were hoping that the snow banks along the side of Charles St. where it meets Main Street could be knocked down as they are rather high and it's very hard to see when trying to merge onto Main St. especially. The other place they're really bad if the city could possibly help is on either side of the driveway for 595 Main St. (around the corner, 1st driveway on the left when entering Charles St., next to 6 Charles). The snow banks are extremely high on either side of the driveway and you can't see when pulling out into the road so it's been dangerous, but there's nowhere else to put them and they've been packed up further by the street snow removal.

1495982,Woburn,Other,Open,"Good Day,I reside on Mass Ave. in Woburn and am concerned about the safety of traffic within my neighborhood. With all of the snow we've received this winter the street has become much more narrow allowing only one car to pass at a time.  We essentially have to clear about 5 feet of snow at the ends of our driveways that really should be plowed as part of the street. We also need to clear about 5 feet of snow to get to one of the fire hydrants on our road.  The other is completely covered and impossible to get to. Our road is wide enough for two cars and being a dead end, has room at the end for snow to be moved to.  My biggest concern is the entering/exiting from Mass Ave to Wheeling Street and from Wheeling Street onto Rt. 38.  The drifts have become so high, there really is no safe way to see oncoming traffic.  This part of Rt. 38 is challenging on a good day because it is on a curve that drivers speed by, but couple that with not being able to see over piles makes it quite dangerous. Wheeling Street has also been reduced to one lane, making entering/exiting quite challenging.  This is very unsafe since many local drivers speed through Wheeling without thinking of any oncoming traffic from Mass Ave, and the 10 foot snow pile makes it hard to see oncoming traffic from the top of Wheeling.  Please help us in improving safety for our neighborhood.

I'm very appreciative to the DPW for all of their long tiring hours of hard work plowing while the storms hit however I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated by how our leaders/managers in city hall have addressed snow removal after the fact especially on some of the most travelled main streets. The last significant snow fall was about a week ago. A week later, Eastern Ave is unacceptable! Broadway is a embarrassing! How is it possible that snow removal on both of these main thorough-ways has still not been done!? The snow was only plowed down the middle of the road. But now there are huge snow banks at least 4-5 feet off the curb. Cars parked on Eastern Ave are sitting half into the flow of traffic. The same applies around the block on Broadway! Where are homeowners/residents expected to park? The way Broadway was plowed (or lack there of) near the creek next to Walgreens is somewhat of a disgrace!?? Because these streets were left how they were, it just adds to the daily traffic gridlock. It's actually sad that no one has still done anything about it!Every other surrounding city (Everett, Malden, Revere, etc) are working day and night to remove the piles of snow on the main roads...to widen the streets so cars can park and not impede on traffic but Chelsea has still not addressed these two main streets.
